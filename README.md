This repository contains the research work and implementation developed for my Master's Degree Thesis in Management Engineering at Politecnico di Torino.  
The project focuses on the development and optimization of a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** model to predict **machining times in milling processes** using **3D mesh-based part representations**.
The study aims to enhance predictive accuracy compared to traditional machine learning approaches (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) and to explore feature-level and architectural ablations to understand the contribution of geometric and process-related information.
